    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am interested in learning about what is useful, and what is true under certain assumptions. I love proving conjectures, and reasoning through or finding counterintuitive results. I enjoy rockhounding and the asssociated geology and chemistry. I try to recreate the effects of plants described as useful by various cultures. I have had many mind-blowing experiences exploring forests. I found a caterpillar that was a victim of mind-controlling wasp larvae. I've experienced immediate toothache relief using the plant Coptis trifolia. I took a video of a slug descending from a tall forest canopy using a sting of slime, just like a spider or caterpillar would do using silk. I have unidentified rocks that I need help understanding or identifying. Sadly, I have experienced and learnt about destroyed or inhibited cultures and ecosystems, and these experiences have cut to the core of my childhood and wellbeing. I have been angered by statements and emails from organizations in Ontario that attempt to conceal their environmental and cultural impacts. Many city councils and individuals don't understand the importance of composting food waste, and I hope this changes soon. My favorite ethnobotanical investigation is personally and socially controversial. I believe I have deduced information about chemical properties that could result in the pursuit of important information through chemical analysis. I expand my knowledge in all areas, and I love to learn from others. I live in North Bay, Ontario, and I have always wanted to find mayapples and sassafrass. Shout out to ethnobotanists down south! Shout out to anybody who has a mutual interest in learning! Feel free to contact me using the methods below.</p>
